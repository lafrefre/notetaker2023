## Overview

Welcome to the Note Taker project! This application allows you to write and save notes, helping you organize your thoughts and tasks effectively. However, there are a couple of issues that need to be addressed, and I'll explain them in this README.

The Note Taker project consists of both a front-end and a back-end. The front-end is already created, and your task is to build the back-end using Express.js. The back-end should store and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## Issues

### 1. Non-Functional Buttons

The "Save Note" and "Clear Form" buttons do not work as expected. When you enter a new note title and text, these buttons should appear in the navigation at the top of the page. Clicking on "Save Note" should save the new note and make it appear in the left-hand column, while "Clear Form" should reset the input fields. However, this functionality is not currently working.

### 2. Heroku Payment Requirement

When attempting to deploy the application to Heroku, you might encounter a payment requirement. As of my last update in January 2022, Heroku started requiring a credit card on file for some actions, such as adding add-ons or exceeding certain limits. Please be aware that this issue may persist and could prevent you from deploying the application on Heroku without a valid payment method.

### 3. Notes Not Saving

Even though the "Save Note" button is not working, when it is fixed, you may find that the notes you create are not being saved as expected. This could be due to issues in the POST request handling or file writing logic in the back end.
